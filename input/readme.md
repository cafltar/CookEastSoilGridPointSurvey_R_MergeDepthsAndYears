  * From Github: https://github.com/cafltar/CookEastGeospatialGeoreferencePoints_R/tree/master/Output
  * Georeference points for CookEast - in unprojected WGS84
* [CookEast_GeoReferencePoints_2016_IL](CookEast_GeoReferencePoints_2016_IL)
  * From [My Drive\Projects\CafLogisticsFieldMapping\2017\Received]
  * Ian Leslie says this should be most accurate georef points - in UTM Zone 11N
* [acidWashedSamples_1998-2008_20180918.xlsx](acidWashedSamples_1998-2008_20180918.xlsx)
  * Created by Bryan Carlson and Quiping Peng (Ellen)
  * Copied values from [Team Drives\CookEastSoilGridPointSurvey\Received\FromQiupingPeng_20180810\1998 2008 and 2015 inorganic carbonates temporal change.xlsx]
  * Selected values that were highlighted in green from worksheet "1998 2008 2015 SIC summary", combined with reweighs from: [MS_20180901_Peng Reweighs Final Report.xls]
